🔹 What is a comment in CSS?
A comment in CSS is a piece of text meant only for developers. It is ignored by the browser and does not affect styling or layout.

It is used to:

Explain what the CSS code does

Leave notes or reminders

Temporarily disable parts of the code (commenting out)

🔹 Syntax of CSS Comments
/* This is a CSS comment */

Starts with /*

Ends with */

Can span one or multiple lines

No support for single-line comment syntax like // (unlike JavaScript)

🔸 Examples
✅ Single-line comment:
/* Set background color to blue */
body {
  background-color: blue;
}

✅ Multi-line comment:
/* 
  Header Styles
  Used for top section of page
*/
header {
  height: 80px;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
}

✅ Commenting out a property (useful for testing):
h1 {
  color: red;
  /* font-size: 40px; */
}

🔹 Where Can You Use CSS Comments?
Inside a .css file

Inside a <style> tag in HTML

Inside inline <style> blocks

Even within CSS rules or selectors

✅ Example inside selectors:
p /* paragraph tag */ {
  font-size: 16px;
}

✅ Example inside rules:
div {
  color: black; /* fallback color */
  /* color: #333; */
}

 Common Mistakes
Mistake	Why It's Wrong
// comment	❌ Not valid in CSS – this is JavaScript-style comment
Missing */	❌ Comment won't end, breaking the rest of your CSS
Nesting comments	❌ You can't nest comments inside other comments

/* This is a comment
   /* This is nested – causes error */
*/

🧠 Best Practices
Use comments to organize your stylesheet:
/* ======= Header Section ======= */
Comment complex styles for future understanding

Don't overuse comments – keep your code clean and readable
