JavaScript (JS) is a powerful and versatile scripting language mainly used for web development,
 but its features go far beyond that. Here's a detailed breakdown of its core features:

  1. Lightweight & Interpreted
JavaScript is interpreted by the browser (not compiled), which makes it fast to run and easy to debug.
It's lightweight, meaning it doesn’t require a large runtime or complex setup.

let x = 10;
console.log(x + 5); // Outputs: 15

2. Client-Side Execution
JS code runs directly in the browser.
It allows dynamic updates to the user interface without reloading the page.

document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button Clicked!");
});

3. Dynamic Typing
JavaScript uses dynamic typing, so you don’t need to declare variable types.
A variable can hold any type of data at different times.

let data = 42;     // number
data = "hello";    // now a string

4. First-Class Functions
Functions are treated like variables.
You can assign, pass, and return functions.

function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
const sayHi = greet;
console.log(sayHi("John")); // Hello, John


5. Event-Driven Programming
JavaScript reacts to user actions like clicks, mouse moves, or keyboard inputs.
Events are handled using callbacks.

document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  console.log(`You pressed: ${e.key}`);
});


6. Platform-Independent
Runs in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
Also works on the server via Node.js.


7. Prototype-Based Object-Oriented
JS supports objects and inheritance using prototypes, not classical classes (although ES6 added class syntax).
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}`);
};

const p = new Person("Alice");
p.sayHello(); // Hello, I am Alice


8. Support for Closures and Lexical Scope
Functions can access variables from the scope in which they were defined — known as a closure.

function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2


9. Asynchronous Programming (Promises, async/await)
JS can handle asynchronous operations like API calls, timers, etc.

Uses:
Callbacks
Promises
async/await

async function fetchData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://www.google.com");
  const data = await res.json();
  console.log(data);
}


10. Built-in Functions and Standard Libraries
Includes many built-in math, string, date, and array functions.
console.log(Math.max(1, 4, 10));     // 10
console.log("hello".toUpperCase()); // HELLO


11. Interoperability with HTML & CSS
JavaScript can manipulate DOM, change CSS styles, and dynamically generate content.

document.getElementById("title").style.color = "red";


12. Modular Development (ES6 Modules)
JavaScript supports import and export for modular code organization.
// utils.js
export function add(x, y) { return x + y; }

// main.js
import { add } from './utils.js';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

Final Thoughts
JavaScript is:
Versatile: Works on both client and server (via Node.js).

Evolving: With ES6+, it supports modern features like classes, modules, async/await.

Essential: Core part of web development stack (HTML + CSS + JS).
