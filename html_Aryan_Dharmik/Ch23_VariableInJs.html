 What is a Variable?
 A variable in JavaScript is a named container for storing data values.

let name = "Pathik";
let age = 30;

Variables help you:
Store values
Reuse them
Update them
Manipulate data dynamically

How to Declare Variables
JavaScript provides 3 main keywords to declare variables:
| Keyword | Scope          | Reassignable?        | Redeclarable? | Hoisted?                |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `var`   | Function scope | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes (but undefined)   |
| `let`   | Block scope    | ✅ Yes                | ❌ No          | ✅ (but not initialized) |
| `const` | Block scope    | ❌ No (immutable ref) | ❌ No          | ✅ (but not initialized) |


1. var (old, avoid in modern code)
var message = "Hello";
console.log(message); // Hello

var title = "Hi again"; // Allowed

Function-scoped (not block-scoped)
Can lead to bugs due to hoisting & re-declaration

2. let (modern, preferred for changeable values)
let count = 5;
count = 10; // ✅ allowed


Block-scoped (within {} like in loops or if)
Cannot be redeclared in same block
Better control over variable lifetime

 3. const (constant binding, safest)
 const PI = 3.14;
// PI = 3.14159; ❌ Error
const user = { name: "Pathik" };
user.name = "Shah";  // ✅ allowed: object is still mutable

Must be assigned during declaration
Reference is fixed, but object contents can still change

Variable Naming Rules
Allowed:

Letters (a–z, A–Z)
Digits (not at start)
Underscore _ and dollar sign $

Not allowed:
Reserved words like class, if, while
Starting with a number

let user1 = "John";
let $status = "active";
let _temp = 99;


Variable Scope
| Type       | Where accessible                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Global** | Declared outside any function       |
| **Local**  | Inside a function or block          |
| **Block**  | Between `{}` (via `let` or `const`) |


Variable Hoisting (Important!)
In JavaScript, declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope — but only for var.
console.log(a); // undefined (due to hoisting)
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
let b = 5;


Good Practices
Use const by default, only use let if you need to reassign
Avoid var in modern JavaScript
Use clear, descriptive names
Don’t pollute the global scope

Example Summary
const name = "Pathik";      // constant value
let score = 10;             // can be updated
score += 5;

if (true) {
  let localMessage = "inside block";
  console.log(localMessage);
}
// console.log(localMessage); // ❌ ReferenceError


Final Tip:
const for constants ✅
let for variables that may change ✅
var only for legacy code ❌
