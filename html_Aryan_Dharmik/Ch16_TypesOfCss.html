Here's a detailed explanation of the three main types of CSS: Inline, Internal, and External.

🌟 What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the look and layout of HTML elements — colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, etc.

There are 3 main ways to apply CSS to an HTML document:
🔸 1. Inline CSS
📌 What is it?
CSS written directly within an HTML element’s style attribute.
✅ Syntax:
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">Hello Inline CSS</h1>

✔️ Advantages:
Quick and easy for testing or small changes

Overrides both internal and external CSS due to higher specificity

❌ Disadvantages:
Hard to maintain in large projects

Code becomes messy

No reusability

🔍 When to Use:
When you want to apply a style to only one element

For quick debugging or testing


🔸 2. Internal CSS
📌 What is it?
CSS defined inside the <style> tag within the <head> of the HTML document.
✅ Syntax:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue;
      font-family: Arial;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello Internal CSS</h1>
</body>
</html>

✔️ Advantages:
Keeps all styles in one place for a single page

No need for an external file

❌ Disadvantages:
Styles are not reusable across multiple pages

Increases HTML page size

🔍 When to Use:
For single-page websites

When you want quick control without linking an external file

🔸 3. External CSS
📌 What is it?
CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using <link>.

✅ Syntax:
style.css

h1 {
  color: green;
  font-size: 30px;
}

index.html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

✔️ Advantages:
Keeps HTML and CSS separate and clean

CSS can be reused across multiple pages

Makes maintenance easy

Great for larger projects

❌ Disadvantages:
Requires an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file

Styles won't be visible if the CSS file is missing or the link is broken

🔍 When to Use:
For multi-page websites or large applications

When you want scalable and maintainable styling

| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Where it's written | In `style` attribute of element | Inside `<style>` tag in `<head>` | In separate `.css` file         |
| Reusability        | ❌ No                            | ❌ No                             | ✅ Yes                           |

| Performance        | ✅ Fast (only 1 element)         | ⚠️ Medium                        | ✅ Best for large projects       |
| Specificity        | ✅ Highest                       | ✅ High                           | ⚠️ Lower (overridden by inline) |


🎯 Best Practices
✅ Use External CSS for most real-world projects
⚠️ Use Internal CSS for small projects or quick testing
❌ Avoid Inline CSS except for very small, one-off customizations
