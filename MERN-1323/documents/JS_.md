| **First-class functions**    | Functions can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions |
| **Asynchronous programming** | Handles async operations using callbacks, promises, and `async/await`                    |
| **DOM Manipulation**         | Can access and change HTML/CSS dynamically                                               |
